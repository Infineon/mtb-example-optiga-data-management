# OPTIGA&trade; Trust M: Data and certificates management

This example demonstrates how you can manage data and certificates on a OPTIGA&trade; Trust M V3 security solution using a PSoC&trade; 6 MCU as a bridge. This example has the following two setups:

- **Example mode:** Figure 1 shows a generic example demonstrated as part of the ModusToolbox&trade; project showing direct API calls such as `optiga_util_read_data`, `optiga_util_write_data`, and `optiga_util_protected_update` to read, write, and securely update the data on the OPTIGA&trade; Trust M device.

- **Provisioning mode:** Figure 2 shows a special example, where the `optigatrust` Python module can be used to directly access the device and manipulate internal settings. In this case, the host MCU is turned into a bridge to allow Python commands reach the security solution so that the communication occurs in the following sequence:

   **Python Script <-> USB <-> PSoC&trade; 6 MCU <-> I2C <-> OPTIGA&trade; Trust M**

- **Provisioning mode:** Do the following:
   1. Install an `optigatrust` Python module.

   2. Open the `modus-shell` tool (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_2.X)*.

   3. In the terminal emulator, execute the following command:

       ```
       pip install optigatrust
       ```

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[Hello world](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01 --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

Depending on the configuration, use either [Example mode](#example-mode) or [Provisioning mode](#provisioning-mode).


### Example mode

The examples are presented in the form of various API calls.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Open the *Makefile* in any text editor, find the line `PROVISIONING_MODE` and change the value from '1' to '0', and then save the change.

    ```c
    # Define whether the example should be compiled in provisioning mode
    PROVISIONING_MODE=0
    ```

4. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

5. After programming, connect the serial terminal and see the output there.


### Provisioning mode

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open the *Makefile* in any text editor, find the line `PROVISIONING_MODE` and change the value from '0' to '1', and then save the change.

    ```c
    # Define whether the example should be compiled in provisioning mode
    PROVISIONING_MODE=1
    ```

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

4. After programming, unplug the board from the USB port and reconnect it again. Make sure that all serial communication to that port (for example, working Tera Term sessions) are closed.

5. Open the `modus-shell` tool again as described in the [Software setup](#software-setup) section.

6. To try out the connection with the security solution, execute the following command:
   ```
   optigatrust object --id 0xe0e0 --outform PEM
   ```

   **Note: if you see a message like the one below, try to repeat the command, as sometimes the stadard output/inout isn't cleaned and some rest information stays**
   
   ```
   $ optigatrust object --id 0xe0e0
   No Start Sequence found
   Error: 0x202
   Could not find module 'C:\Users\user\ModusToolbox\tools_3.0\python\lib\site-packages\optigatrust\csrc\lib\liboptigatrust-i2c-win-amd64.dll' (or one of its dependencies). Try using the full path with constructor syntax.
   libusb: Failed to connect
   uart: Failed to connect
   i2c: Failed to find library liboptigatrust-i2c-win-amd64.dll in C:\Users\user\ModusToolbox\tools_3.0\python\lib\site-packages\optigatrust\csrc\lib
   ```
   
7. To see the metadata associated with that object, execute the following command:
   ```
   optigatrust object --id 0xe0e0 --meta
   ```

For more examples, see the [*optigatrust* command line interface](#optigatrust-command-line-interface) section.

To use the command-line interface to inject/import custom credentials you can follow [this](ImportCustomCredentials.md) guidance.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â€“ once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

### Provisioning mode design

The general idea is to link the `optigatrust` Python module and an OPTIGA&trade; Trust M security solution through I2C. For this, the PSoC&trade; 6 board is flashed with a dedicated firmware, which turns it into a bridge device translating the commands from the Python library to the security solution. In this case, the setup looks similar to the following sequence:

 **optigatrust Python modules <-> USB (UART) <-> PSoC&trade; 6 MCU <-> I2C <-> OPTIGA&trade; Trust M**

The firmware implements a very rudimentary finite state machine (the *provisioning_sm.c* file) with the following four states:

- `INIT_STATE` â€“ Initialization state to open the Infineon I2C protocol with the security solution. Afterwards, a transition into the `RX_STATE` is triggered.
- `RX_STATE` â€“ A state in which the host (PSoC&trade; 6 MCU) is waiting for a start sequence over the UART interface:
    ```
    uint8_t start_seq[] = {0xbe, 0xef, 0xde, 0xad}`)
    ```
    Afterwards, the APDU from the Python script is forwarded over the Infineon I2C protocol to the OPTIGA&trade; Trust chip, at the same time expecting an answer either from the security solution or an error code. Afterwards, a transition into the `TX_STATE` is triggered.
- `TX_STATE` â€“ A state which prepares the answer from the OPTIGA&trade; Trust M to send over the UART interface back to the host system. Afterwards, the state is again in `RX_STATE`.
- `ERROR_STATE`


### Example mode design

The main file executes several sub-examples:

- Read out the data from the OPTIGA&trade; Trust M using `example_optiga_util_read_data()`
- Write data to the OPTIGA&trade; Trust M using `example_optiga_util_write_data()`
- Demonstrate how to work with build-in counters using `example_optiga_util_update_count()`
- Run a protected update routine for key objects, data objects, and metadata associated with the objects/keys using `example_optiga_util_protected_update()`. For more information, see [How to run a custom protected data/key/metadata update](#ImportCustomCredentials.md).
- Read the coprocessor unique ID using `example_read_coprocessor_id()`. This is a demonstration of the `optiga_util_read_data()` function call using a coprocessor unique ID object.


### *optigatrust* command-line interface
